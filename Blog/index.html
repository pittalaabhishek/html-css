            <h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
            <p>
                Photography is more than just capturing moments; itâ€™s an art that lets me express creativity and see the world differently. Through my lens, I can freeze time and preserve the beauty around me.

                My favorite techniques include long-exposure shots for night photography and macro photography for capturing intricate details of small objects. Each method teaches me patience and opens up new perspectives.
